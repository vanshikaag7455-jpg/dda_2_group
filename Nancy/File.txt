Data Transformation means converting raw data into a more useful or understandable format for analysis, reporting, or machine learning.

🔹 Definition
Data transformation is the process of cleaning, structuring, and converting data from one format or structure into another.
It helps make data consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis.

🔹 Example
Raw data:
NameAgeCityDate of Birthnitu21delhi2004/05/06raj22mumbai2003/06/07

NameAgeCityDOB (Formatted)Nitu21Delhi06-May-2004Raj22Mumbai07-Jun-2003
✔ Capitalized names
✔ Standardized city names

🔹 Common Data Transformation Steps


Data Cleaning – removing duplicates, fixing errors


Data Formatting – changing date, time, or number formats


Data Aggregation – summarizing data (e.g., total sales per month)


Data Normalization – scaling data values into a consistent range


Data Joining/Merging – combining multiple tables


Data Encoding – converting text to numbers (for ML models)



🔹 Tools Used


Excel / Power Query


Power BI (Transform Data window)


Python (Pandas library)


SQL (using functions like CAST, CONCAT, etc.)


ETL tools (Talend, Informatica, SSIS)



🔹 Purpose


Improve data quality


Make data compatible with analysis tools


Ensure consistency across datasets


Support better decision-making
